Functional specification:
The project will be to create a client and server, which will allow
users to rank different golf courses, give comments and see where
they are geographicly located. You will also as a client be able to add golf courses if they don't already exists on the webpage.

The ranking will preliminary be based on:
	- The geograpic location
	- Course condition (fairway, green...)
	- The greenfee
	- Restuarant condition
	- Enviroment
	- Overall opinion

The client should also be able to search for golf courses based
on different criterias, such as:
	- Course character
	- Proximity
	- The greenfee
	- Textbox for name search
		Advanced filtering
		- Ranking criteriums

Technical specification:
	- Server Framework
		We are planning on using Django as the serverside framework
	- Client Framework
		We are planning on using AngularJS as the client framework
	- Datastorage
		We will use mongoDB, since we have never used it and it
		seems to fit with how we think the DB could look like.
	- Authentication
		The authentication will be handled using openID
	- Different functionality based on authentication
		We will make sure that logged in users will have access
		to more features than a ordinary user
	- Phone/Tablet/PC handling
		We may implement handling for different screen sizes, based
		on if there will be enough time for such a thing
	- Testing
        During development we will use KARMA for testing.
		We may also use Selenium, based on how much time we have.
		We will prioritize this before the previous statement
